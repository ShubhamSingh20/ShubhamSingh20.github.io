      <description>Introduction One of my freelance projects, DGTOnline is a platform for a Mumbai based competitive exam coaching center. The main purpose of this platform was to provide a simple and easy to use interface that could help the faculty at the institution to easily conduct test with more accuracy and more frequency. At the same time the platform would help students to get accustomed to web based testing portals for these competitive examinations.</description>

      <description>Introduction Developed a Web app with Oauth2 based REST API of Codechef, a competitive programming website. The web app works as a recommendation engine that consumes the REST API and recommends new questions to the user according to their previously solved problems on the platform.
