      <description>Introduction One of my freelance projects, DGTOnline is a platform for a Mumbai based competitive exam coaching center. The main purpose of this platform was to provide a simple and easy to use interface that could help the faculty at the institution to easily conduct test with more accuracy and more frequency. At the same time the platform would help students to get accustomed to web based testing portals for these competitive examinations.</description>

      <description>I am an undergrad student at Gujarat Technological University, currently persuing my undergrad in Computer Engineering. I have 3+ years of experience in developing applications using web based and native technologies. I have also worked as a freelance developer and help build software based solutions for multiple local businesses.
At this site I will be sharing some of my personal projects and I will also try to post technical articles related to programming on weekly or monthly basis.</description>
