      <description>Introduction Last week I took part in a CTF, and one of the problems from the &amp;ldquo;Web&amp;rdquo; category seems pretty intriguing to me. Although I was able to get the Flag, but couldn&amp;rsquo;t submit the flag in time, so no points for me ðŸ˜”.
The interesting thing about this problem was, that the technology which needed to be exploited was something I am pretty familiar with and had a lot of experience in, but still, even after working with that tech stack for years, I was unaware of this vulnerability.</description>

At the same time the platform would help students to get accustomed to web based testing portals for these competitive examinations.</description>

      <description>Introduction One of my freelance projects was at a coaching institute which needed to automate the process of sending daily timetables to their students. Up until this point, someone had to manually forward the daily schedule to students sometimes in a group and sometimes even individually to up to 150-200 students. Even students from the same class can have different classes each day due to remedial classes, reassessment examinations, etc.</description>
