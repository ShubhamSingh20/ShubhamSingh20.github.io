<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>One of my freelance projects was at a coaching institute which needed to <code>automate the process of sending daily timetables to their students</code>. Up until this point, someone had to manually forward the daily schedule to students sometimes in a group and sometimes even individually to up to 150-200 students. Even students from the same class can have different classes each day due to remedial classes, reassessment examinations, etc.</p>

<p>The crux of the project was to make a program that could take different excel files containing the timetable and contact info of the students as input and render and sent messages to the WhatsApp account of the students.</p>

<p>Main features of the application &ndash;</p>

<ul>
<li>Should work with <em>.xlsx</em>, <em>.odt</em> and <em>.csv</em> file extensions</li>
<li>Timetable and student can have 1:1 or 1:N relation</li>
<li>Should have Whatsapp Login and QrCode creator (similar to WhatsApp web)</li>
<li>Program should be in a form of windows executable</li>
<li>Ability to parse and extract timetable details such as subjects, timings, and sessions from different files</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="technical">Technical</h2>

<ul>
<li>Go programming language, since the program needs to compile to native code</li>
<li>A custom-built WhatsApp &ldquo;Authentication&rdquo; and &ldquo;Send message&rdquo; service, since WhatsApp didn’t provide an API for developers</li>
<li>A separate module for generating Qr code from Whatsapp Web and displaying the Qr Code to a user for scanning</li>
<li>After scanning Qr code a session will be generated by Whatsapp which I can use for making subsequent requests for “Send message” service</li>
<li>A parser module specifically built as per the structure of the messages and data provided by the client.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although I cannot provide a link to the original code for obvious reasons. I am providing a link to the Proof of concept program that I wrote for the client as a demo. You can find the <a href="https://github.com/ShubhamSingh20/WhatsAppAuto">POC here</a></p>
